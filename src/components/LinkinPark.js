            Formed by Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson, and other members in Agoura Hills, California, Linkin Park gained prominence with their debut album *Hybrid Theory*, which was certified Diamond in the U.S. The bandâ€™s ability to blend hard rock, rap, and electronic music made them pioneers in the nu-metal genre.
            Tragically, their lead vocalist Chester Bennington passed away in 2017, leaving behind a lasting legacy in the world of music.
