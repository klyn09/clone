        <p className="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-8">
          The reason I created a website like this is because I was given an assignment to clone the SSA website. 
          However, I didnâ€™t have an idea for the website, so I decided to create a site like this because I had plenty of ideas. 
          This idea came to me when I went to Gramedia and saw a guitar there. 
          From that moment, I was inspired to change the website layout, which was initially intended for a school website, 
          into a site themed *My Favorite*.
